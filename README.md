# A-four-in-a-line-game-solver-using-a-GP
In this question, we have implemented strategies for four in a line game. This is a game for two players. There are balls of a certain color for each player, and each player in turn throws a ball of his color in the cells of the vertical board. The playing field consists of seven columns and six rows. The goal of the game is to collect four balls of your color vertically or horizontally or diagonally before the enemy does it.

Goal:
Find strategies (an algorithm) for winning the game with genetic programming.

Tools:
1) Programming language – Python.
2) Evolutionary computation framework – DEAP.
